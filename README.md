This repository contains a sample setup for Dockerizing microservices using Docker Compose. This setup is designed to demonstrate how to containerize multiple microservices and run them together using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone github.com/benncaramine/Dockerize_MS_F
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Dockerize_MS_F
    ```

3. Build the Docker images and start the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Access the microservices:

    The microservices should now be running. You can access each service using its respective endpoint.
